# PSOperations

This is an adaptation of the sample code provided in the Advanced Operations session of WWDC 2015. The sample code was originally written in Swift 2.0. This framework has been adapted to work for Swift 1.2. For usage examples, see [link] and/or look at the included unit tests.

Feel free to fork and submit pull requests, as we are always looking for improvements from the community.

This also provides fixes to issues found in the original sample code, mostly: 
* Canceling operations would not work.
* Canceling functions are slightly more friendly.
* Negated Condition would not negate.
